Based on 40+ customer conversations and competitive analysis.

## Strategic Positioning

### Core Message
**"Your CRM is blind to WhatsApp. Eazybe gives it eyes."**

### Key Differentiators vs Competitors (Cooby, Timelines, Rasayel, Gallabox)

| Capability | Eazybe | Competitors |
|---|---|---|
| WhatsApp Business App + API | ✅ Both | Most require API-only |
| Keep existing chat history | ✅ | ❌ Start fresh |
| Track personal numbers | ✅ | ❌ |
| Live in 30 minutes | ✅ Chrome extension | Requires API migration |
| Mini CRM in WhatsApp | ✅ | ❌ |
| Coexistence (App + API) | ✅ | ❌ |

### Validated Pain Points (from customer calls)

1. **Zero Visibility** - "Deals move in WhatsApp. CRM shows stale data."
2. **Hot Deals Slip Away** - "Lead asks for pricing. No reply for 6 hours. Deal lost."
3. **Employee Exit = Data Walkout** - "Rep leaves, customer conversations leave too."
4. **Fragmented Records** - "Personal WhatsApp causes lost context during handovers."
